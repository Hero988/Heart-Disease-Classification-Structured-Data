# Heart Disease Classification Project

## **Important Note**
**You may need to edit the code to correctly load and read the dataset based on your file structure and data source.**
Ensure the dataset is accessible and properly referenced in the code before running the project.

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify the presence of heart disease based on medical and health-related features. The workflow includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and the application of classification algorithms.

This project is implemented in Python and leverages popular libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying the most significant features for classification.
- **Classification Models**: Training and evaluating machine learning models to classify heart disease.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-classification.git
   cd heart-disease-classification
   ```
2. **Edit the code to ensure the dataset is correctly loaded.**
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart-disease-classification-project.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model training.

## Results
The project provides insights into the dataset and evaluates the performance of the classification models. Key outputs include:
- Visualizations of feature importance.
- Crosstabs for feature-target relationships.
- Accuracy and metrics of the trained models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical and health-related attributes to classify the presence of heart disease. Ensure you have the dataset loaded correctly for successful execution.
